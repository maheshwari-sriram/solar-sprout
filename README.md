Developed an automated irrigation system using solar energy( IOT project): Solar panels are normally kept in a one location This means they cannot seize the maximum amount of sunlight as the sun moves over the sky. To generate more power from solar panels they need to face the sun all the time. In this project we will create a solar tracker that undergo the solar panels are always directed to the sun path so that they can produce high power. Dualaxis tracking panels can be rotated in many directions, maintaining the sun-facing adjustment throughout the day. Our solution overcomes the limitations of fixed panels, provides a better way to use solar energy and improves overall performance. Dual-axis solar tracking solar panels are advanced solar panels that follow the direction of the sun throughout the day. They can tilt and turn in two directions allowing them to capture as much sunlight as possible. These dual axis trackers generate 45% more energy than static solar panels. They work well in many places, such as rural or urban areas, and can help farms by providing energy. These solar panels use smart technology to accurately track the sun. Going forward, dual-axis solar tracking panels will become key for clean energy production. Thus the energy stored will be used automatically to reduce the usage of water in the farming field
